    <h2>Why did I study Software Engineering?</h2>
    <h3>1. Problem Solver</h3>
    <p>Being a software engineer will enable me to create apps/programs which will solve real-life problems.</p>
    <h3>2. Future Proof</h3>
    <p> With the rapidly developing digital world that we now live in,
        software development is an essential part of future proofing ones career 
        and studying software engineering will help me achieve my goals.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Curiosity</h3>
    <p>I am a curious person who enjoys putting pieces of the puzzle together.
        I take pleasure in finding out how things work and learning the function of each part
        that comprises the whole. Same can be said in software development
        whereas each code corresponds to a specific function.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Make the world a better place</h3>
    <p>Whenever I walk around, I am almost always with thought of "How I wish there
        is a software that does this and that". My brain overflows with ideas to make things
        more convenient, more reliable, and simply better than it already is. With software engineering,
        I will gain the knowledge and skills needed to put my thougths into reality
        with hopes of making this world a better place.
